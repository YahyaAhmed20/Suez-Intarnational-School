<h4>

Greetings, fellow web enthusiasts!

I'm Yahya, a passionate back-end developer who embarked on a journey to craft an intranational school website using the dynamic duo of PHP and CSS. To ensure seamless data management, I delved into the realm of database coding, establishing a robust system that securely stores and retrieves school information.

Two Forms, One Vision

At the heart of this website lie two interactive forms: Registration and Contact Us. Each form serves a distinct purpose, catering to the needs of prospective students and inquisitive minds alike. The Registration form streamlines the enrollment process, while the Contact Us form acts as a bridge between the school and the community.

PHP: The Powerhouse Behind the Scenes

PHP, the maestro of web development, played a pivotal role in orchestrating the forms' functionality. I meticulously crafted PHP scripts that seamlessly integrate with the database, ensuring that every submission is captured and stored with precision.

A Symphony of Technology

The harmonious blend of PHP, CSS, and database coding has given rise to an intranational school website that is both informative and engaging. It stands as a testament to the power of technology to connect, inform, and empower.
